# Stimulating Simulations
Initially create true to the orignial ports of the (TRS-80?) BASIC games from *Stimulating Simulations Second Edition* by C.W. Engel (C) 1979. Then refactor and add more fun features!

**Soccer I,II,II**: I will revisit these, I am not sure it can be ported using the Console Class.

**Art Auction**: Bid on paintings to hopefully sell for a profit! The middle of the three prices is the mean, 70% of the time the price will be between the lower and higher numbers.

**Monster Chase**: Try to avoid being eaten by the monster! You are locked in the cage with the monster, move with N,E,S,W

**Lost Treasure**: The book has a 9x9 map that is essential to playing this game, I put a rough representation of it in a seperate readme file for this game. You find yourself at a random location on the map and must find the treasue at the center. Be careful you could veer off course.

**Gone Fishing**: How many fish can you catch on this 8x8 lake? Each area has a different probability to catch any fish. You may have better luck farther from the dock.

**Forest Fire**: Lightening has ignited a portion of a 9x9 forest. 70% chance to spread to adjacent area. Drop chemicals at rows and columns, 50% chance each of the adjacent areas will have the burn time reduces. Enter 0 for the row to start a backfire, it will burn out the next turn and does not spread.

**Buisness Management**: Can you make a profit?
